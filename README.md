# Udacity_LandingPage (First Project)

## What's Done 

I tried to apply what I learned in the lessons in the first project and I will always try to develop the code

1. I added a new section in a HTML file
2. I built the code to generate the navigation items dynamically
3. I have applied the active state on scroll to the sections.
4. I'm following the udacity javaScript style guide.
